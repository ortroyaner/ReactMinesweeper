### About the Game

### How to Play

You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to flag all the mines (without clicking on any bombs) you win.
Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.
To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To flag a square you think is a bomb, point and shift+click.

### Main Features

* Configurable number of rows, columns and mines.
* Responsiveness: you can also play on tablets and mobile devices!
* Secret mode to reveal all cells without clicking it.
* Game state persistency if you accidentally refresh the page.
